This is my [neovim](https://neovim.io) config.

# Install

`pacman -S neovim`

This will require [the vim-plug window manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Make sure it is installed properly.

Make sure you run a `:checkhealth` command and follow the instructions to install the ruby client (needed for terraform plugins).

Gutentags will require ctags. `pacan -S ctags`
